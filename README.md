# Ant Simulation codes

## Lattice Ant Model

This simulation is based on [Non-stationary aging dynamics in ant societies](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022519311002347). The only thing that is changed is that the model in the paper uses toroidal surface whereas this code is a bounded rectangle with boundary effects.

## Continuous-Time Correlated Random Walk

Work in progress
